# Tauri Setup Complete

## Overview
The Tauri project structure has been successfully initialized and configured for the Image Viewer application.

## What was configured:

### 1. Tauri Installation
- Added `@tauri-apps/cli` as dev dependency
- Initialized Tauri with `pnpm tauri init`

### 2. Project Configuration
- **Application Name**: Image Viewer
- **Window Size**: 1200x800 (min: 800x600)
- **Dev Server**: http://localhost:5173
- **Build Commands**: Using pnpm

### 3. Permissions Setup
- File system access (`fs:default`, `fs:read-all`, `fs:read-dirs`, `fs:read-meta`)
- Dialog access (`dialog:default`, `dialog:allow-open`, `dialog:allow-save`)
- Asset protocol enabled for serving images directly from file system

### 4. Rust Backend Structure
- Created placeholder Tauri commands for all required functionality:
  - `browse_folder` - Directory traversal
  - `read_image_file` - Image loading with metadata
  - `get_supported_image_types` - Supported format list
  - `open_folder_dialog` - Native folder selection
  - `save_session_dialog` / `load_session_dialog` - Session management
  - `save_auto_session` / `load_auto_session` - Auto-session persistence

### 5. Frontend Integration
- Added Tauri API packages (`@tauri-apps/api`, `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs`, `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`)
- Updated Vite configuration for Tauri compatibility
- Created test component to verify Tauri connection

### 6. Cross-Platform Build Support
- Configured for Mac and Windows compilation
- Asset protocol for secure image serving
- Native file dialogs and keyboard shortcuts

## Available Scripts
- `pnpm tauri:dev` - Start development server with Tauri
- `pnpm tauri:build` - Build application for production
- `pnpm tauri info` - Show Tauri environment information

## Next Steps
The foundation is ready for implementing the actual functionality in subsequent tasks:
- Task 2: Core data models and interfaces
- Task 3: Rust backend commands implementation
- Task 4+: Vue components and UI implementation

## Verification
- ✅ Rust backend compiles successfully
- ✅ Frontend builds without errors
- ✅ Tauri commands are registered and accessible
- ✅ Asset protocol configured for image serving
- ✅ Cross-platform permissions configured
