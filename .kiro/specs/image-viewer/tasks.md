## Cu
rrent Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FEATURES**
The core image viewer functionality is fully implemented and working:

- **Complete tab management system** with keyboard shortcuts, reordering, and context menus
- **Full zoom and pan controls** with mouse wheel, keyboard shortcuts, and UI controls
- **Comprehensive keyboard shortcut system** using centralized configuration
- **Cross-platform file system integration** via Tauri
- **Responsive image viewing** with fit-to-window and actual-size modes
- **Gaming-style navigation** (A/D keys, Shift+A/D for tabs, Alt+A/D for reordering)
- **Native file picker integration** for seamless UX

### üöß **REMAINING WORK**
The following features still need implementation:

1. **Session Persistence** (Tasks 11-12): Auto-save/restore and manual session management
2. **Error Handling** (Task 13): Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
3. **Testing Suite** (Task 14): Unit, component, integration, and E2E tests
4. **Performance Optimization** (Task 15): Lazy loading, memory management, and build optimization

### üìù **NOTES**
- The application is fully functional for core image viewing workflows
- Session commands exist in Rust backend but are currently stubs
- Basic error handling is implemented but could be more comprehensive
- No testing framework is currently set up (would need Vitest/Jest + Vue Test Utils)
