# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a cross-platform image viewer application built with Vue.js that allows users to browse, open, and view images in a tabbed interface. The application will provide intuitive folder navigation and support for multiple image formats, designed to work seamlessly on both Mac and Windows operating systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through folders on my computer, so that I can browse and locate image files to view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a folder navigation interface
2. WHEN the user clicks on a folder THEN the system SHALL display the contents of that folder
3. WHEN the user navigates to a parent directory THEN the system SHALL update the view to show the parent folder contents
4. IF a folder contains image files THEN the system SHALL display them with visual indicators (thumbnails or file icons)
5. WHEN the user double-clicks on a folder THEN the system SHALL navigate into that folder

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to open single or multiple images from a folder, so that I can view them in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on an image file THEN the system SHALL select that image
2. WHEN the user double-clicks on an image file THEN the system SHALL open that image in a new tab
3. WHEN the user selects multiple images (using Ctrl/Cmd+click) THEN the system SHALL allow opening all selected images
4. WHEN the user opens multiple images THEN the system SHALL create a separate tab for each image
5. IF the user attempts to open a non-image file THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view images in separate tabs, so that I can easily switch between multiple images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is opened THEN the system SHALL create a new tab with the image filename as the tab title
2. WHEN multiple images are open THEN the system SHALL display all tabs in a tab bar
3. WHEN the user clicks on a tab THEN the system SHALL switch to display that image
4. WHEN the user closes a tab THEN the system SHALL remove that tab and display the next available tab
5. IF only one tab remains and it is closed THEN the system SHALL return to the folder navigation view
6. WHEN the user drags a tab THEN the system SHALL allow reordering tabs by dropping it in a new position
7. WHEN the user drops a tab in a new position THEN the system SHALL update the tab order accordingly
8. WHEN there are few tabs open THEN the system SHALL display tabs with larger width for better visibility
9. WHEN there are many tabs open THEN the system SHALL display tabs with smaller width to fit more tabs
10. WHEN there are more tabs than can fit in the tab bar THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling for the tab list
11. THE system SHALL support unlimited number of tabs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work on both Mac and Windows, so that I can use it regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on macOS THEN the system SHALL properly handle Mac-specific file paths and navigation
2. WHEN the application runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL properly handle Windows-specific file paths and navigation
3. WHEN the application accesses the file system THEN the system SHALL use cross-platform compatible methods
4. WHEN the application displays keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL show appropriate shortcuts for the current operating system (Cmd on Mac, Ctrl on Windows)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view common image formats clearly, so that I can see my photos and graphics properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens a JPEG image THEN the system SHALL display it correctly
2. WHEN the user opens a PNG image THEN the system SHALL display it correctly with transparency support
3. WHEN the user opens a GIF image THEN the system SHALL display it correctly with animation support
4. WHEN the user opens a WebP image THEN the system SHALL display it correctly
5. WHEN the user opens a BMP image THEN the system SHALL display it correctly
6. IF the user attempts to open an unsupported format THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic image viewing controls, so that I can interact with the images effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is displayed THEN the system SHALL display it in fit-to-window mode by default
2. WHEN the user scrolls on an image THEN the system SHALL allow zooming in and out
3. WHEN an image is larger than the viewing area THEN the system SHALL provide scrollbars or pan functionality
4. WHEN the user presses Ctrl + (Windows) or Cmd + (Mac) THEN the system SHALL zoom in on the image
5. WHEN the user presses Ctrl - (Windows) or Cmd - (Mac) THEN the system SHALL zoom out on the image
6. WHEN the user presses Ctrl / (Windows) or Cmd / (Mac) THEN the system SHALL toggle between fit-to-window and actual size

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my open images to persist when I close and reopen the application, so that I can continue working with the same images without having to reopen them manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user closes the application with images open in tabs THEN the system SHALL save the current session state
2. WHEN the user reopens the application THEN the system SHALL restore all previously open image tabs that still exist
3. WHEN the user reopens the application THEN the system SHALL restore the previously active tab
4. IF a previously opened image file no longer exists THEN the system SHALL skip opening that tab

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and load different sessions of open images, so that I can organize different sets of images for different projects or purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Save Session" THEN the system SHALL prompt for a session name and save the current state
2. WHEN the user selects "Load Session" THEN the system SHALL display a list of saved sessions to choose from
3. WHEN the user loads a session THEN the system SHALL close current tabs and open the images from the selected session
4. WHEN the user loads a session THEN the system SHALL restore the previously active tab from the saved session
5. WHEN the user deletes a session THEN the system SHALL remove it from the saved sessions list
6. IF files in a loaded session no longer exist THEN the system SHALL skip opening those tabs
